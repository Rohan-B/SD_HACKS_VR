# SD_HACKS_VR
Occulus Rift @ SD Hacks, Rohan and Mohamed 

Overview: 
We designed and built this  virtual reality game over the 36 hour hacking
period at SD Hacks. This project represented alot of firsts for us as not only
was it our first experience developing in Unity, we also had never worked in 
C# before. Furthermore, it was our first time using an occulus rift (it was super cool)
as well as the Myo armband (cool concept but the armband is a little tough to use). 

Game: 
We designed the game to be short and simple. The game consists of you riding
in a jeep while trying to shoot down some floating blocks to get points. Aiming
was controlled through a small reticule displayed in the headset and you
"fired a shot" by squeezing your arm, an action registered through the 
Myo armband. The jeep would take you through a variety of landscapes giving you
the opportunity to earn points and beat the high score.
